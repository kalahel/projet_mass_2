## Selling protocol

The seller responds with a string like this `name_of_buyer,buying_quantity,buying_price,seller_name`, this is why it's forbiden to put commas in agent's name.

This is a CSV format, do not put space.

To confirm transaction seller sends it's own name as content to be easy identifiable by buyer.
